# Job Descriptions

Job descriptions for Tech roles at Skit. We don't cover blurb about the company,
privacy policy, etc. here. Those are slapped on these items before sharing on
job portals.

JDs are organized in _function_ named directories.

We are not imposing any structure on JD other than adding a front matter that
would contain meta information like this:

```
---
authors: @lepisma
groups: research, product
teams: core-ml, research-ml
level: L4
active: false
---
```

For publishing, share the markdown with recruitment team and let them post on
portals.
