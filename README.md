## About Skit

Skit (previously known as Vernacular.ai) is an AI-first SaaS voice automation
company. Its suite of speech and language solutions enable enterprises to
automate their contact centre operations. With over 10 million hours of training
data, its product - Vernacular Intelligent Voice Assistant (VIVA) can currently
respond in 16+ languages, covering over 160+ dialects and replicating human-like
conversations.

Skit currently serves a variety of enterprise clients across diverse sectors
such as BFSI, F&B, Hospitality, Consumer Electronics and Travel & Tourism,
including prominent clients like Axis Bank, Hathway, Porter and Barbeque Nation.
It has been featured as one of the top-notch start-ups in the Cisco Launchpad’s
Cohort 6 and is a part of the World Economic Forum’s Global Innovators
Community. It has has also been listed in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia start-ups 2021
for its remarkable industry innovation. We are growing really fast and on track
to become _the_ Voice AI powerhouse.

## Who we are looking out for?

Tech teams at Skit work on two main projects. First is VIVA, our voice bot that
goes beyond run-of-the-mill voice bots by exploiting features and behaviors that
come from a deep understanding of shades of human-machine speech dialogs. Second
is an advanced speech tech platform for large scale enterprises that helps build
speech products at unprecedented level of naturalness.

Building these systems requires extensive research and product development work
in Spoken Language Understanding, Speech Recognition, Paralinguistics, Response
Production as well as low latency ML Systems, Infrastructure, and Large Scale
Audio AI pipelines.

We are looking for people to invent and mature advanced technologies to make our
voice bots understand and adapt to conversations that are considered challenging
for any speech based system right now. Along the way, you get to publish in
prestigious conferences and work with a strong community of researchers from the
field.

For the platform side, we are looking for experienced technologists to architect
and build the whole system. More than just reducing cost and time to go live,
our aspiration is to bring in the next wave of innovation in the voice bot
universe with this platform, similar to what Amazon did with AWS. For this, we
are working on systems that go beyond standard APIs and SDKs for building bots
by providing revolutionary new foundational components and abstractions.

Specific roles are arranged in JDs in this repository under the two main
functions, ML and Engineering.

## Structure of this repository

JDs are organized in _function_ named directories.

We are not imposing any structure on JD other than adding a front matter that
would contain meta information like this:

```
---
authors: @lepisma
groups: research, product
teams: core-ml, research-ml
level: L4
active: false
---
```

For publishing, share the markdown with recruitment team and let them post on
portals. There are more things added to the description like privacy policy etc.
Those are slapped on these items before sharing on job portals.

You might also see `level` in the metadata. Based on our last thoughts on
levels, we have the following rough scale:

| Level | Remarks            |
|-------|--------------------|
| L1    | Mostly fresh folks |
| L2    |                    |
| L3    |                    |
| L4    | Tech Lead          |

Higher levels are discussed on a case by case basis at the moment.
