# Machine Learning Research Engineer

We are looking for ML Research Engineers, at multiple levels, to invent and
mature advanced technologies to make our voice bots understand and adapt to
conversations that are considered challenging for any speech based system right
now. It involves extensive research and product development work in Spoken
Language Understanding, Speech Recognition, Paralinguistics, Response Production
as well as ML Systems and Infrastructure.

### Responsibilities

+ Design, build and evaluate Machine Learning systems.
+ Perform experiments and statistical analyses to draw conclusions and take
  modeling decisions.
+ Study, implement and extend state of the art systems.
+ Take part in regular research reviews and discussions.
+ Build, maintain and extend our open source solutions in the domain.
+ Write well-crafted programs at all levels of the system. This includes the
  data pipelines, experiment prototypes, fast and scalable deployment models,
  and evaluation, visualization and monitoring systems.
 
### Requirements

+ Practical Machine Learning experience as demonstrated by earlier works.
+ Knowledge of and ability to use tools from theoretical and practical aspects
  of computer science. This includes, but is not limited to, probability,
  statistics, learning theory, algorithms, software architecture, programming
  languages, etc.
+ Good programming skills and ability to work with programs at all levels of a
  finished Machine Learning product. We prefer language agnosticism since that
  exemplifies this point.
+ Git portfolios and blogs are helpful as they let us better evaluate your work.

## Our Team

Our team of engineers and researchers work on building our voice bot, VIVA, and
an advanced speech conversational platform for large scale enterprises. VIVA
goes beyond run-of-the-mill voice bots by exploiting features and behaviors that
come from a deep understanding of shades of human-machine speech dialogs.

We believe in open innovation and you can check out our work on github [here](https://github.com/skit-ai), and
our tech website [here](https://tech.skit.ai/). You can also follow our [tech handle on twitter](https://twitter.com/SkitTech/) to know
what we are up to these days.
