# Machine Learning Research Intern

We are looking for an ML Research intern for a duration of 5 months. As an intern, you will be working closely with the core-ml team. You will be involved in owning various product initiatives, creating protypes and delving into research papers. 
Our team works closely with the research team, broadly on the topics such as Spoken Language Understanding, Speech Recognition, Paralinguistics and Response Production.

### Responsibilities

+ Design, build and evaluate Machine Learning systems.
+ Perform experiments and statistical analyses to draw conclusions and take
  modeling decisions.
+ Study, implement and extend state of the art systems.
+ Write research outcomes and publish documentations
+ Take part in regular research reviews and discussions.
+ Build, maintain and extend our open source solutions in the domain.
+ Write well-crafted programs at all levels of the system. This includes the
  data pipelines, experiment prototypes, fast and scalable deployment models,
  and evaluation, visualization and monitoring systems.
 
### Requirements

+ Practical Machine Learning experience as demonstrated by earlier works.
+ Knowledge of and ability to use tools from theoretical and practical aspects
  of computer science. This includes, but is not limited to, probability,
  statistics, learning theory, algorithms, software architecture, programming
  languages, etc.
+ Good programming skills and ability to work with programs at all levels of a
  finished Machine Learning product. We prefer language agnosticism since that
  exemplifies this point.
+ Git portfolios and blogs are helpful as they let us better evaluate your work.

## Our Team

Our team of engineers and researchers work on building our voice bot, VIVA, and
an advanced speech conversational platform for large scale enterprises. VIVA
goes beyond run-of-the-mill voice bots by exploiting features and behaviors that
come from a deep understanding of shades of human-machine speech dialogs.

We believe in open innovation and you can check out our work on github [here](https://github.com/skit-ai), and
our tech website [here](https://tech.skit.ai/). You can also follow our [tech handle on twitter](https://twitter.com/SkitTech/) to know
what we are up to these days.
