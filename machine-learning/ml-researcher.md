# Machine Learning Researcher

We are looking for ML Researchers to invent advanced technologies to make our
voice bots understand and adapt to conversations that are considered challenging
for any speech based system right now. Along the way, you get to publish in
prestigious ML conferences and work with a strong community of researchers from
the field.

Here are the high level areas of work for the research team:

+ Paralinguistics
+ Speech Recognition and Synthesis
+ Language and Dialog Understanding
+ Response Production
+ Conversations, Behaviors, and Personalities
+ Text and Audio mining

### Responsibilities

+ Develop and experiment with new approaches for problems in the directions
  listed above.
+ Work on, and deliver research outputs and prototypes.
+ Study, implement and extend state of the art systems.
+ Take part in regular research reviews and discussions.
 
### Requirements

+ Practical Machine Learning Research experience as demonstrated by earlier
  works.
+ Strong prototyping ability. This is covered by programming and understanding
  of commonly used ML frameworks.
+ Knowledge of and ability to use tools from theoretical and practical aspects
  of computer science. This includes, but is not limited to, probability,
  statistics, learning theory, algorithms, etc.
+ Git portfolios and blogs are helpful as they let us better evaluate your work.

## Our Team

Our team of engineers and researchers work on building our voice bot, VIVA, and
an advanced speech conversational platform for large scale enterprises. VIVA
goes beyond run-of-the-mill voice bots by exploiting features and behaviors that
come from a deep understanding of shades of human-machine speech dialogs.

We believe in open innovation and you can check out our work on github [here](https://github.com/skit-ai), and
our tech website [here](https://tech.skit.ai/). You can also follow our [tech handle on twitter](https://twitter.com/SkitTech/) to know
what we are up to these days.
