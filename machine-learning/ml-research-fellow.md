## Our Team

Our team of engineers and researchers work on building our voice bot, VIVA, and
an advanced speech conversational platform for large scale enterprises. VIVA
goes beyond run-of-the-mill voice bots by exploiting features and behaviors that
come from a deep understanding of shades of human-machine speech dialogs.

We believe in open innovation and you can check out our work on github [here](https://github.com/skit-ai), and
