With the knowledge of building scalable applications, fault tolerant systems
and emerging technologies, you will be responsible for designing and managing
applications, evolving and boosting productivity for the Skit Runtime

You will be delivering a cutting edge product aimed at improving customer
experience with Call Centres. You will be joining us at a time when we're on a
shoot-the-moon style growth trajectory having grown our workforce 5x in the
last year.

### Responsibilities

- Design and develop highly scalable, highly available, reliable, secure and
  fault-tolerant systems.
- Building and managing automated build/test/deployment environments.

  roles.

- Experience troubleshooting server performance - memory issues, GC tuning,
  resource leaks etc.
- Ability to design and implement low latency RESTful or GRPC services.

### Bonus Requirements

We'd love it if you ticked these boxes. But they're definitely not deal
breakers.

- Experience working with stateful sets (Mongo, Redis, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ,
  Kafka).
- Experience working with AWS.
- Experience with Kubernetes.
- Understanding of Observability systems like (Prometheus, Loki).


## Our Team

Our team of engineers and researchers work on building our voice bot, VIVA, and
an advanced speech conversational platform for large scale enterprises. VIVA
goes beyond run-of-the-mill voice bots by exploiting features and behaviors
that come from a deep understanding of shades of human-machine speech dialogs.

We believe in open innovation and you can check out our work on github
[here](https://github.com/skit-ai), and our tech website

twitter](https://twitter.com/SkitTech/) to know what we are up to these days.
