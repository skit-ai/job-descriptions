## 🚀 What are we up to?

We're fixing call centers, but let's understand how are we doing it.

### **Problem(s)**

The primary function of a call center is to act as the face of the business and talk to end-users on its behalf. When you go deeper, you realize it is a cost-and-operationally heavy function to run. Full of problems, both from the business and user's perspective.

**Why, you ask?**

- It starts with you hiring people that can speak on behalf of your business, then you need to train them so that they can represent your brand instead of speaking like individuals.
- Then comes the next hurdle, the high attrition rate in the industry. Primarily because of two reasons, (i) call centers are considered a temporary job provider, and (ii) there is no proper career ladder in the sector.
- It moves you to a vicious cycle of hiring → training → hiring, that requires you to do both things on a regular basis throughout the year.
- Then there are seasonal effects on the industry, called event-days. It's the time of the year when the business transactions will peak up, and so does the call volumes. Call centers handle this situation by temporarily ramping up the workforce, either by hiring extra or getting the team to work extra (eventually impacting the end-user experience in both ways).

Hold on! Let us tell you just one of the end-user side of the problems. Pretty sure you've faced it, and it's just the tip of the iceberg.

🤦🏻‍♀️ In the age of digital convenience, it's extremely easy to get a cab in 2-minutes.

But if the same cab has a problem, let us know how many times you've reached a resolution in 2-minutes.

### **Solution**

In simple terms, we are building a platform, VIVA, that allows businesses to design conversational agents that can speak to their customers and resolve their queries.

We are doing this in 15+ Indian and global languages. At times, without the end-users noticing if they are talking to a machine.

🔗 Yes, you read that right. Visit [our website](https://vernacular.ai/) to hear more success stories.

### **Benefit**

As a call-center, when you deploy our platform:

- You've higher bandwidth availability, given the conversation agents are now doing the heavy lifting
- You provide a consistent and satisfying customer experience
- All of this is happening when you're investing less money in the system
